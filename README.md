# Password-Manager
A Password Manager is a secure application designed to store, generate, and manage user credentials for various online and offline accounts. The project aims to enhance security by eliminating the need for users to remember multiple passwords while ensuring strong, unique credentials for each account.

This application will feature a master password that unlocks access to stored credentials. Data will be encrypted using advanced encryption algorithms such as AES-256 to prevent unauthorized access. Users can save login details, generate complex passwords, and automatically fill credentials into websites and applications.

Key features include multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security, password strength analysis, auto-locking, and cloud or local storage options. The system will also support secure password sharing, allowing users to share credentials with trusted contacts safely.
A browser extension or mobile app integration can enhance usability. This project aims to simplify password management while enforcing strong security practices, making it ideal for individuals and businesses looking to protect sensitive information.
